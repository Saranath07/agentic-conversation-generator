For example, AI systems can identify early signs of lung cancer in chest X-rays with over 90% accuracy, potentially saving thousands of lives through early detection. Additionally, AI-powered clinical decision support systems can analyze patient data to provide treatment recommendations and risk assessments, processing vast amounts of medical literature, clinical guidelines, and patient records to suggest evidence-based interventions. These technologies have the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.",

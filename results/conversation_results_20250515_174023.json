AI algorithms have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in analyzing medical images, such as detecting abnormalities in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, with some systems achieving over 90% accuracy in identifying early signs of lung cancer. The FDA has approved several AI-based diagnostic tools, including IDx-DR for diabetic retinopathy detection and Viz.AI for stroke detection, which are being integrated into clinical workflows. Additionally, AI-powered clinical decision support systems analyze patient data to provide treatment recommendations and risk assessments, with systems like IBM Watson for Oncology recommending treatment options for cancer patients based on a vast database of medical literature. These developments aim to enhance clinical decision-making, improve patient outcomes, and protect patients through early detection and evidence-based interventions.",

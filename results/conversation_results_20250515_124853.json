The topics listed are consistent with common applications of AI in healthcare, suggesting a good understanding of the subject matter.",
      "relevance": 0.9,
      "relevance_feedback": "The answer directly addresses the question by providing a list of main topics related to AI in healthcare, which is the focus of the question. However, the relevance could be improved by ensuring these topics are indeed the primary focus of the document.",

      "overall_score": 0.8,
      "overall_feedback": "The answer demonstrates a good understanding of AI applications in healthcare and is mostly relevant to the question asked. However, to achieve a higher score, it should be verified against the document for factual accuracy, and the response could be phrased in a more conversational manner.",

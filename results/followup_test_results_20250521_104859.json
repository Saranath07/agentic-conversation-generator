For instance, AI algorithms have shown remarkable accuracy in analyzing medical images, detecting abnormalities in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. The FDA has approved several AI-based diagnostic tools, including IDx-DR for diabetic retinopathy detection and Viz.AI for stroke detection. These tools are now being used in healthcare institutions to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. AI-powered clinical decision support systems are also being used to provide treatment recommendations and risk assessments. However, early implementations of these systems have faced challenges, and newer versions are being developed to improve their performance."

These systems analyze patient data and process vast amounts of medical literature, clinical guidelines, and patient records to suggest evidence-based interventions. For instance, IBM Watson for Oncology analyzes patient medical information against a vast database of medical literature to recommend treatment options for cancer patients. While early implementations faced challenges, newer versions have shown promising results in aligning with expert recommendations."

2025-05-20 12:47:36,204 - root - DEBUG - answer: AI algorithms can enhance diagnostic imaging in oncology by analyzing medical images with high accuracy, detecting abnormalities, and identifying early signs of cancer. For example, they can detect lung cancer in chest X-rays with over 90% accuracy. AI-based diagnostic tools, such as IDx-DR and Viz.AI, have been approved by the FDA and are being integrated into clinical workflows. These tools can match or exceed the performance of experienced radiologists, potentially saving thousands of lives through early detection.

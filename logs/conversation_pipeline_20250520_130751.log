Deep learning models can detect abnormalities in X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, often matching or exceeding the performance of experienced radiologists. For example, AI systems can identify early signs of lung cancer in chest X-rays with over 90% accuracy, potentially saving thousands of lives through early detection.\n\nsaving thousands of lives through early detection.\nThe FDA has approved several AI-based diagnostic tools since 2018, including IDx-DR for diabetic retinopathy detection and Viz.AI for stroke detection. These tools are now being integrated into clinical workflows across major healthcare institutions.\n\n### Clinical Decision Support\n\nhcare institutions.\n\n### Clinical Decision Support\nAI-powered clinical decision support systems analyze patient data to provide treatment recommendations and risk assessments. These systems can process vast amounts of medical literature, clinical guidelines, and patient records to suggest evidence-based interventions.\n\nt records to suggest evidence-based interventions.\nFor instance, IBM Watson for Oncology analyzes patient medical information against a vast database of medical literature to recommend treatment options for cancer patients.

Regulations such as HIPAA in the United States and GDPR in Europe establish frameworks for protecting patient information, but implementation challenges remain.\n\ninformation, but implementation challenges remain.\nHealthcare organizations must implement robust security measures to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Techniques such as federated learning, which allows AI models to be trained across multiple institutions without sharing raw data, offer promising solutions to privacy challenges.\n\n### Algorithmic Bias\n\ntions to privacy challenges.\n\n### Algorithmic Bias\nAI systems can perpetuate or amplify existing biases in healthcare delivery if trained on non-representative data.

For example, AI-powered systems can identify early signs of lung cancer in chest X-rays with over 90% accuracy. Additionally, AI-driven clinical decision support systems can analyze patient data to provide personalized treatment recommendations. However, to fully leverage the potential of AI in healthcare, it is essential to address challenges such as integrating AI into clinical workflows, ensuring data privacy and security, and mitigating potential biases in AI algorithms.
